<p>Chili Verde? I thought chili was supposed to be red!</p>
<p>Well, this isn&#39;t your average chili! Chili Verde is a Southwestern classic with a fresh flavor that perks you up with every bite. And it still has all of the favorites components of a &#39;regular&#39; red chili:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich, complex falvors</li>
<li>Smoky sauce</li>
<li>Meat stewed to perfection</li>
<li>Plenty of heartiness to fill you up</li>
</ul>
<p>Chili Verde is perfect for warm days when you need a pick-me-up meal. It&#39;s hearty but won&#39;t make you bloat, it&#39;s deep and complex but somehow fresh, and it can be made with any meat, not just pork!</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>2 tablespoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon, divided, plus more to taste</li>
<li>5 poblano peppers</li>
<li>5 cubanelle peppers</li>
<li>2 pounds tomatillos (about 15 medium), husks removed</li>
<li>2 jalepeno peppers, split in half lengthwise, stems removed</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves, whole peeled</li>
<li>1 bunch cilantro leaves</li>
<li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
<li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li>Black pepper to taste</li>
<li>3 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>In large bowl, toss pork with 2 tablespoons salt until thoroughly coated. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, roast poblano and cubanelle peppers by placing them directly over the flame of a gas stove until deeply charred on all surfaces, about 10 minutes total. Place peppers in a bowl and cover with a large plate. Let steam for 5 minutes, then peel <strong>without using water</strong>. Discard stems and seeds. Transfer to food processor.</li>
<li>Preheat broiler to high. Toss tomatillos, garlic, and jalapeños with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. Broil until charred, blistered, and just softened, turning once halfway through cooking, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to the food processor along with any liquid.</li>
<li>Add half of the cilantro to the food processor and pulse mixture until it is roughly pureed but not smooth, about 8 to 10 one-second pulses. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 275°F. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large Dutch oven over high heat until smoking. Add half of pork and cook without moving until well browned, about 3 minutes. Stir pot and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 7 minutes. Remove cooked pork and add remaining pork and onions and cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until onions are softened, about 4 minutes. Add cumin and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add back in the browned pork.</li>
<li>Add chicken stock and puréed chiles to pot and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven, leaving lid slightly ajar. Cook until sauce is thickened and pork shreds easily with a fork, about 3 hours. Remove from oven and return to stovetop.</li>
<li>Skim off and discard any excess fat. Adjust to desired consistency by adding water or boiling and reducing. Stir in remaining cilantro and season to taste with more salt. Serve immediately with warm tortillas, diced onions, sour cream, cheese, cilantro, and lime wedges.</li>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t have a gas stovetop, how can I roast the peppers?<ul>
<li>The peppers can be roasted over any food-safe open flame, so your outdoor grill would work as well. You can also roast the peppers under the broiler of your oven.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can this recipe be used with different meats?<ul>
<li>Of course! Chili Verde is best served with pork, but chicken or any poultry would taste great as well. Beef would work, but you will have to adjust the temperature and cooking time to make sure the meat is cooked through and tender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can&#39;t I just sear all of the meat at once?<ul>
<li>The meat is seared in batches to ensure even browning. This step is included to make sure the chili is flavorful, and really does add a lot. However, the meat will still cook fully in the oven even if you don&#39;t brown it at all. It may take a little longer in the oven.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can I use different peppers?<ul>
<li>Definitely! Fresh hatch chiles work excellent with this recipe, and you can mess with the ratio of cubanelles and poblanos to your liking. Jalepenos can be replaced with serranos or even habaneros if you&#39;re feeling spicy.</li>
</ul>
